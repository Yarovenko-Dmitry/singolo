I would like to note that I have submits to deadlines.
I also have changes after the deadline. It was allowed by Sergey Shalyapin [(link)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0M9Rz-wXYas&feature=youtu.be&t=5640).
I hope for your goodwill and objectivity.
I will also be grateful if you can give me code style tips.
I think that according to the requirements of the task DOM everything was done, I tried.
If you have any questions, please contact.
